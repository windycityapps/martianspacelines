 Welcome to Martian Spacelines
 An awesome way of scheduling your trips to the Moon and Mars
 
 Some quick facts about computing travel time to Mars
#
# Mars distance from from Earth fluctuats and goes from a max distance of 35 million miles and min distance 250 million miles
# depending and where it is in its 2 year cycle
#
# Mars travel towards or away from Earth 432,000 miles per day
#
# Orion spacecraft top speed is 20,000 mph
#
# On October 30, 2015 Mars was 205 million miles from Earth 
#
# I used October 30 as base to calculate where Mars is, how many miles away, and how long it would take Orion to make to Martian orbit.
#
#
# All calculations are estimates.
#
#
# This was a fun project that combines my interest in programming and Astronomy.
#
#
# Enjoy!!
